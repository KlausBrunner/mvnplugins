Maven Provision Plugin

  This plugin provides the capability to provision the artifact in your build
  to a directory on the file system so that it can be installed into the hotdeploy directory
  in your application server such as Tomcat / Jetty / Karaf / ServiceMix

* Usage

  The plugin is designed to be usable in any project, so there's no need to hack your pom.xml

  Try the following command in any project which makes a deployment artifact (jar, bundle, war etc)

+-----
 mvn org.fusesource.mvnplugins:maven-provision-plugin:provision -DoutputDirectory=/foo
+-----

  Where /foo is the directory you want to provision your artifact to.
